RE : Request to Block Unauthorized Collection Accounts and Inquiries from Credit Report under FCRA 605B Again, I am in receipt of a credit file that indicates more fraudulent activity, in the form of Collection Agencies demanding that I pay them monies for accounts that I have never engaged in setting up! Also, there are credit account inquiries on my reports that shows applications for credit that I have not engaged in and should be immediately removed without prejudice! 

I am a victim of identity theft. The information listed below, which appears on my credit report, is the result of identity theft in XXXX The affected accounts are listed below.

This is again a demand to remove such information from the report in question.
